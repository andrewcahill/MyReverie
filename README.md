MyReverie

A new simple side project I am working on. The idea is to build a goal tracking solution set target dates against those goals as well as set milestone markers to track progress. They could be long or short term goals â€“ entirely up to the user.

I have a rough idea of some of the features to add straight away which I will list under the Projects Tab of GitHub.

This is also a way to experiment and learn new technologies as I go, some technologies I will be looking to incorporate are Asp.Net Core, Swagger, Docker,  xUnit.Net and EF Core so far.

I will blog as I develop this application under http://www.aviddeveloper.com/

The solution is not intended to be a complete sample or starter app more of a reference or exploration on learning.
