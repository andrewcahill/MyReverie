    The idea of this repository is to build a goal tracking solution. The goals are could be considered a wishlist of things you would like to acheive by a certain time such as travel to a certain desitnation, acheive a certain qualification, purchase a property, start up a business etc. The set are entirely up to the user - this solution is merely a tool to help users acheive these goals by allowing them to set timelines, reminders, progress trackers, motivational quotations etc.
    I plan to outline the features under the Projects Tab of GitHub.
    In building this solution it enables me to learn and use various new technologies, some technologies I will be looking to incorporate are Asp.Net Core, Swagger, Docker, xUnit.Net and EF Core, Docker, AI/ML, Azure etc.
    I will be building this solution with clean architecture principles in mind as I go.
    I will blog about certain features I implement at http://www.aviddeveloper.com.
